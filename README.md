# ML-Classifier
Machine learning classifier


This is an ML classifier using Keras that can classify any dataset (after slight adaptation of the code). Current dataset is a walking vs running dataset I got from Kaggle, ie. images that are associated with walking or running.


X.pickle is the dataset,
y.pickle is the label set,
walkorrunmodel.h5 is the trained model
